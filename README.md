# ðŸ“šConclusions and Recommendations
- Conclusions
    - Based on the results of the analysis carried out on the E-Commerce Marketplace, there are several important findings. First, __sales performance, number of ordered items, and revenue__ on e-commerce in recent months have been very volatile. __November 2017__ showed __excellent__ performance, with a high number of __orders and revenue__. However, there was a drastic decline in __September 2018__, which had the potential to have a __negative__ impact on future profits.

    - Furthermore, the product that __sells the most__ is the `Bed Bath Table`, while the `Security and Services` product has the __lowest sales__. This shows that products in the `Bed Bath Table` category have high popularity among customers.

    - In terms of __review score__ distribution, __a score of 5__ dominates the total of __66,264__ reviews with a __percentage of 56.5%__, indicating that the majority of customers gave very good reviews to the products they purchased. This shows a high level of customer satisfaction.

    - The distribution of product __delivery times__ tends to be in the __range of 1 to 50 days__, with some other cases of delivery taking longer. However, delivery times that take this long are very rare.

    - In terms of customer __demographic characteristics__, the state of __SP__ has the __largest number of orders__, one of which is the city of __Sao Paulo__ which has the largest number of orders. The __most commonly__ used payment method is `credit_card`, while `debit_card` has a __very small__ number of transactions.

    - There is a __fairly strong positive correlation__ between __product prices and shipping costs__, indicating that the higher the product price, the higher the shipping costs. In addition, there is a __strong positive correlation__ between __product price and payment value__, indicating that the higher the product price, the higher the value of payments made by customers.

    - Meanwhile, the __geolocation distribution__ shows the __SP state__ that occupies the __most geolocation__ point positions, and the state with the __least distribution__ is `geolocation_state` __AP__. However, it is important to note that to understand geolocation distribution patterns in more depth, further analysis is required.

- Recommendations
> Based on these findings, several recommendations can be made. First, further analysis needs to be carried out to find out the __causes of the decline__ in performance in __September 2018__. Factors such as the existence of competitors and marketing campaigns need to be considered. In addition, marketing efforts need to be increased for products with low sales, such as `Security and Services`.

> In terms of __product delivery__, care needs to be taken to ensure that delivery is carried out __on time__ in order to meet customer expectations. In addition, it is worth considering offering __alternative payment methods__ that are more attractive to customers, besides `credit_card`.
